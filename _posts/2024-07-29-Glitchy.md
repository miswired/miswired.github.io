My first adventure into open source hardware and softwareâ€¦ and hardware hacking.

<!-- more -->

So I did a thing. While I have lots of expeirence designing circuit boards, I have always been tasked with protecting hardware from explitation, not designing a tool to exploit hardware. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun along the way. I hope this project sparks peoples curiocity and gives them a jumping off point to build on. So all the hardware and software is open source and there will be lots of documentation help get people started.

See the offical landing page for project details: [Glitchy](http://www.miswired.io/glitchy/)
