The Glitchy is an economical and open source tool built to help introduce two hardware hacking concepts. Power glitching and power analysis. By shorting power to a chip at just the right time for just the right length you can affect the execution flow of the program running on that chip. For instance, when checking if a password is correct or not. Power analysis can give you insight into what a chip is doing and its execution flow, such as extracting secrets such as passwords or encryption keys.

This is a tool to help introduce these concepts at an affordable price. While the tool has its limitations, the hope is that it will inspire more people to explore hardware exploits and educate future hardware designs and their best practices.
